## Introduction
Met with clients to plan their envisioned app and completed it within the week.

## What does the app do?
* Allows mentors to select skills they're willing to tutor in.
* Allows learners to find mentors by name or skill and schedule an appointment with them.
* Uses Calendly and Google Calendar to set and track appointments.

## Tech stack ( you can include logos)
Javascript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MUI

## Technical Challenges and research that you anticipated
* Why, what was the plan to overcome those challenges?
* What did you learn?

## Challenges that were unexpected
* Why was it a challenge
* What did you learn?

## Video Demo / Screen shot walkthrough of the app
* What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product)

## How does the app work?
* What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
* OR What are all the places the data travels?  What happens to that data?
* Optionally include a diagram
* How does the tech stack come together?

## What research was required?

## Workflow and Key lessons from your team - specifically those related to: Agile, CI/CD, testing, working with external stakeholders, ticketing, and user stories.
* Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
* What did you learn from the process
* What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
* Writing tests
* Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

## Any non-MVP tickets (optional)
Code refactorings
Performance Optimizations
Additional features
etc
Notes from your Sprint Retro

## What additional features do you plan to add, how do you plan to implement those features?
* Future refactoring?
* Additional dev ops considerations?
* UI/UX additions?
